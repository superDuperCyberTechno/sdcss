A simple, classless, flexed CSS boilerplate. There's only 3 things to be aware of:
* Rows are custom tags: `<col-row>`. These must only contain columns.
* Columns are custom tags. They come in 13 flavors. Sizes 1 to 12 and `x` which has an automatic width. IE: `<col-1>`, `<col-12>`, `<col-x>`.
* Content in columns are supposed to be put in a container. `<div>` and `<summary>` are currently supported.
